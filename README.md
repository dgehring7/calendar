This is my attempt at a daily calendar app.
Upon first loading the page, the page will load the current date and time from Moment.js a third party API
Once it grabs the current time, it color codes the day; red if it is in the current hour, blue if the hour is in the past, and green is the hour is in the future. So the user is able to see Their activities at a quick glance
Any meetings or activities are able to be put on the calendar and saved using local storage.
Clicking the save button will keep the input on the page so the user can put other things in other hours of the day
